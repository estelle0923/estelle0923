### Hi~ This is my(YeongChae's) github space!👋

-about me 😀

🧡 I'm 13 years old and I am attending Daegu Wolseo Elementary School.

💛 My family members are dad, mom, and older brother.

💚 I am learning Python from my teacher(Tae-kyung Kim) with my friends.

💙 I like math and science and became interested in coding as I learned Python.

💜 I am currently learning functions.

Python is still a bit difficult, but I'll do my best!! 😁
