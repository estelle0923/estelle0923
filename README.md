### Hi~ This is Yeongchae Noh github space!👋

-about me 😀

🧡 I'm 13-year-old and I am attending [Daegu Wolseo Elementary School](http://www.dgwolseo.es.kr/)

💛 My family members are dad, mom, and an older brother.

💚 I am learning Python from my teacher, [Taekyung Kim](http://github.com/ktk1501), with my friends.

💙 I like Math and Science and become interested in coding as I learned Python.

__Python__ is still ~a bit~ difficult, but I will do my best! 😁
